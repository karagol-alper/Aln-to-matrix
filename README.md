# Aln-to-matrix
It essentially transforms a vertically aligned set of sequences into a horizontally aligned set, while preserving the alignment relationships. This is achieved through the calculation of indices and the creation of a 2D matrix. The index calculation (i * a + i) + c is designed to jump between sequences in the original format to create a continuous string of aligned sequences.
